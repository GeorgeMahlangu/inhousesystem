            <H3 class="mb-4">Molobogeng Mashilo</H3>

            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Coming into this position with an understanding
                that
                there are students who
                come from different backgrounds, who are often stressed about their home situation, I have learnt to
                listen more and being empathetic to their plight. Because of that, I have become a very considerable
                person who is able to make objective decisions. It is my view that without the ability to listen, one
                will not get anything done in this position. </p><br>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Additionally, since this position requires one to
                have probing skills and the ability to monitor progress, I have become attuned to the importance of
                talking to the students and members of staff and take their point of view into consideration. In the
                process, I have gained a lot of experience on how to interact and network with people who are well
                versed in different issues and can be of great assistance. </p>
            <h4 class="mb-4"> What are some of the milestones that you have reached with your team? </h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The faculty takes pride in its students’ academic
                excellence, the pass rate and academic support they provide to their students, especially those who are
                struggling academically. However, research conducted by the office of the Assistant Dean of Teaching and
                Learning led by Dr Deon Du Plesis showed that there is a gap in so far as the provisioning of normal
                academic tutoring is concerned and this was and is still evident in the analysis of the students’
                academic performance, hence the promulgation of ICT Faculty’s Standard Operation Procedure Manual (SOP),
                the ICT Faculty decided to take the following milestones to remediate the situation: </p>
            <h4 class="mb-4"> Milestones </h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In order to close the gap identified, the Student
                Academic Support Office decided to start sessions on: </p>
            <ul>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Introduction to chapters at the beginning of
                    each semester, All night study-thon in preparation of
                    semester tests and exams. It was such an honor to witness our students coming together, taking full
                    responsibility for their educational success in their own hands to ensure that they succeed. It’s
                    clear, where there is unity there is power. </li>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Also, a Chairperson of the ICT Girls Forum at
                    the time, my team and I were able to engage our female students in activities that exposed them to
                    the ICT industry, particularly in groundbreaking with the view of empowering them.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">This initiative lead to a group of our female
                    students winning a national GirlCode hackathon, which gave them the opportunity to travel to
                    Netherlands Amsterdam, to attend European Women Intec conference.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In Amsterdam, they got to meet, interact and
                    share good practices with other female tech professionals, diversity advocates and innovators as
                    they unite to define and transform what it means to be a woman in tech.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="mb-4">What vision are you and your team working towards?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Assisting our students in achieving their
                    educational goals, empower them and promotes academic excellence. </li>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">As the Office of the Student Academic
                    Support, we envision our faculty as being a leader in optimizing student's potential for academic
                    success.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">To foster individual growth by being
                    attentive to their academic and social needs. </li>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">To provide academic guidance, and preserve
                    confidentiality.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="mb-4">How are the tutors providing academic support to students seeing that COVID-19 has come
                with its own set of restrictions?</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">With the Covid-19 pandemic it has become difficult
                to have the face to face tutoring sessions like in the past and therefore an online tutoring solution
                has been implemented. On those basis, our tutors have been hands on. As a Faculty of ICT, the paperless
                system works even better for us.</p>
            <h4 class="mb-4">How do you motivate your team?</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">It is my belief that Students who are not
                motivated will not learn effectively.
                This is why I do everything in my powers to motive my team at all times. E.g. In one of the sessions
                during Women Intec Conference, where they were talking about tutoring, they highlighted and emphasized
                what I have always said to my team: Tutoring is a two-way street, you get out what you put in. I always
                propound the need to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Get to know their students</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Become creative</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Draw connections to real life</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Be free with praise and constructive in
                    criticism</li>
            </ul>
